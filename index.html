            <p>JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is easy to learn and use. Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language that is commonly used for building large scale applications.</p>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in syntax, but they are not the same. They belong to different programming paradigms and have different use cases.</p>
